	<h2>Mediums</h2>
		<p>Acrylic paint was developed in the 1950's. The pigment is suspended in
			acrylic polymer emulsion has the characteristic of rubber. It is very 
			fast drying, and will not decolor or crack over time.</p> 
		<p>Here are some acrylic sets that I recommend for beginners<p>

			</ul> 
		<p>Oil paint is considered the most versatile medium because you can thin it 
		out or built up in more vibrant layers. One advantage of oil paint is that it
		does not dry as easily, which gives the artist time to blend or fix mistakes. </p>
	<h3>Styles</h3> 
		<p>One of my favorite styles is abstract art. Abstract artists freely uses color, 
		shapes, forms, and gestural art to represent an idea. It is up to the viewer to 
		interpret what the art conveys. Famous abstract artists include Kandinsky, Pollock, 
		and Rothko.</p>
