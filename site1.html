<h2>Mediums</h2>

		<p>Acrylic paint was developed in the 1950's. The pigment is suspended in
			acrylic polymer emulsion has the characteristic of rubber. It is very 
			fast drying, and will not decolor or crack over time. The essentials for acrylic painting include a palette, a palette knife for blending, brushes that are marked as approved for acrylic paint, a canvas, water,
			and paper towels. </p> 
		<p>Here are some acrylic sets that I recommend for beginners:<p>
			<ul>

			</ul> 
		<p>Some general rules to keep in mind when painting with acrylics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Progress from mid/light tones to darker colors.</li>
				<li>Begin creating large shapes then move to small details. You want to create a 
				sort of "base" before going into finer details. Try to study the reference picture
				and see what colors you can pick up.</li>
				<li>Keep in mind that acrylics dry FAST!! You want to try to work relatively fast 
				and most blending should be done on your palette. You can try to reactivate the paint
				by using a little water from a spray bottle.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Oil paint is considered the most versatile medium because you can thin it 
		out or built up in more vibrant layers. One advantage of oil paint is that it
		does not dry as easily, which gives the artist time to blend or fix mistakes. </p>
			<ul>
				<p>Note: The pigment in oil paint often contains hazardous chemicals that 
				can irritate your skin if you touch it. Wear gloves and other protective
			 clothing when using oil paint.</p>
			 </ul> 
			<p>Oil paint dries very very slowly. So, if you think the surface is dry, the 
			paint underneath can still be wet. You must be very careful. Also, a golden rule 
			is to paint thin swatches of paint first and then layer slowly. After you are done,
			you must add a layer of an oil-based medium to prevent it the paint from cracking 
			in the future!</p>
