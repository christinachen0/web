		<p>One of my favorite styles is abstract art. Abstract artists freely uses color, 
		shapes, forms, and gestural art to represent an idea. It is up to the viewer to 
		interpret what the art conveys. Famous abstract artists include Kandinsky, Pollock, 
		and Rothko.</p>

						<p>Another type of style is called realism. Realism emerged in France in the 
			1850s. Realism artists focsed on painting the average, working class people, contemporary setting, and 
			depicted scenes just as they saw them. Important leading figures include Gustave Courbet.
