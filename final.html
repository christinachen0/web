<h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors!</h1>
<h2>Christina Chen, Period 9</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Project Description</b></li>
			This is an interactive python program. Users play the game rock, paper, or scissors against a computer.  
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Instructions</b></li>
			Open the python program and click Run. You have to press the key "Enter" to begin the game. Then, type in your choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The results and the scores will appear. You can continue playing or exit the game by typing "Y" or "N". If you type in something invalid, the program will tell you to try again. 
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li><b>How it works</b></li>
			You will be playing rock, paper, or scissors against a computer. The program uses user input codes, so it is interactive. The user goes first by typing into their choice: either rock, paper, or scissors. After the user chooses, the computer opponent will also choose one of the three choices made possible by the random module (so this is completely fair, no cheating). Using elif/if/else statements, every possible outcome of the game is noted, and the winner is chosen based off of those rules. For example, rock will win over scissors and scissors will win over paper. The user gains a point if they win, but does not lose any points if they lose. Using a while loop can allow the user to play the game over and over again. If you want to stop playing, the break is coded so the game doesn't run infinitely. Lastly, the program will continuously prompt you to type in something valid.

		<ul>
			<li><b>Bugs, Errors, and Things to be Aware of</b></li> 
			<ul>
			<li>Scores does not transfer to the next round.</li>
			<li>Be mindful of the spelling. The game is case sensitive sometimes but it ignores it other times. For example, when you type in "sCiSsORs", the game continues like normal (no error message). But, if you type in "SciSSORS", the game will return an Error message. Both spellings are correct, but the letters are differently capitalized.</li>
